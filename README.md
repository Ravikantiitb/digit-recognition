# Digit-Recognition
The model presented in this repository is a TensorFlow-based Simply Connected Neural Network that can accurately classify handwritten digits ranging from 0-9. The model was trained on MNIST's dataset of handwritten digits and achieved a training set accuracy of 99.67% as well as a test set accuracy of 97.91%.


Using the model is straightforward, just input an image of a handwritten digit and run it through the trained neural network to obtain its classification. If necessary, the pre-trained weights can be fine-tuned for specific use cases.
